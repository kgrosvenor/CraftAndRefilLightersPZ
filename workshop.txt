description=When using the lighter as a light source (equipped), if the lighter drains to 0 fuel, its a bug of zomboid to remove the item from your inventory, this mod replaces the lighter when it depletes and creates an 'Empty lighter' to refuel, this part of the mod works very similar to Refillable Lighers, for defining a custom Lighter with ability replace with another item on deplete. This is a similar concept to a Bottle of Water turning into an Empty Bottle Of Water.

description=When the ligher becomes empty, it will turn into an 'Empty Lighter' from here you can right click it (if you have some petrol) to turn it into a fully fuelled lighter.
